Hackathon Portal
================


This project is a web portal for the Ericsson Data Integrity APIs.

_Check out the portal running at [ericssoncloud.github.io/dev-portal](http://ericssoncloud.github.io/dev-portal/)_

# Where the Portal is Hosted

This is designed to be hosted using GitHub Pages. But, it can certainly be hosted locally or elsewhere.

If you would like to host this somewhere else, you will need to change the URL path at two places within the portal code:  
- src/common/_common.scss
- gulpfile.js
