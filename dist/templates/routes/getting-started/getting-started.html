<h1>ERICSSON CLOUD | Alpha Developer Portal</h1>

<p>
Welcome, here you will find the alpha releases of Ericsson Cloud API’s.  This is a growing, evolving list, based on user’s feedback and real world needs…
<br/>
<br/>
Today, software is the primary way you engage customers.   Your business is your software, and every company is now in the data business.  If you are a global enterprise you want to move to cloud computing to deliver the <inline style="color:#d51b5d">speed and immediacy that your customers demand</inline>, while realizing the <inline style="color:#d51b5d">new economics of cloud computing</inline>.<br/><br/>   
But, to date, the promise of cloud technologies has fallen short for the world’s most demanding enterprises.
<br/></p><br/>
<ul>
<li>Only <inline style="color:#d51b5d">17%</inline> operate a hybrid cloud</li>
<li>Only <inline style="color:#d51b5d">16%</inline> have ERP workloads on cloud</li>
<li>Only <inline style="color:#d51b5d">27%</inline> have digital commercial apps on cloud</li>
</ul>

If you are an enterprise executive working in a highly demanding, performance driven industry, you are continuously being  <inline style="color:#d51b5d">forced to choose between speed and risk</inline>.  You either leverage cloud to deliver software at a faster pace and expose the company to higher levels of risk or, mitigate risk by burdening IT with policies that slow down development efforts in the cloud.
<br/><br/>
Imagine an <inline style="color:#d51b5d">industrial grade cloud</inline>…
</p>
<br>
<ul>
<li>You can trust</li>
<li>With known performance</li>
<li>With known economics</li>
<li>Where needs of the business drive behavior</li>
<li>That’s always available </li>
<li>That doesn’t break the law</li>
</ul>
<br/>
<p>
And then we realize a cloud strategy is not required, rather we need a <inline style="color:#d51b5d">digital industrialization strategy</inline>.  You need one IT infrastructure that can marry legacy with modern, using one automation and governance approach.  You need <inline style="color:#d51b5d">a trusted global partner</inline> that can provide
</p><br/>
<ul>
<li>Advanced cloud technology</li>
<li>People and IT transformation on a global scale</li>
<li>Innovative commercials based on your terms and needs </li>
</ul>

<p><br/>You need a trusted global partner </p><br/>
<ul>
<li>With over 100 years of managing global, predictable, secure infrastructure</li>
<li>That understands governance in 180+ countries</li>
<li>That are experts at managing multiple generations of technology</li>
</ul>
<p><br/>
We start with where you are…
